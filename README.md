This is the place where you can keep all your data visualization content. It includes a default directory structure where you can add lecture material week by week, [litvis examples](gallery/README.md), _narrative schemas_ and _stylesheets_.

The [portfolio folder](portfolio/README.md) is the place where you can work on your weekly exercises and the coursework project. You should _stage_, _commit_ and _push_ the portfolio content to GitHub week by week to provide evidence of continuous engagement in the module.
