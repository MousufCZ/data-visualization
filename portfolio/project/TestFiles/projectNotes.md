UK is currently the top destination in Europe for venture capital, with inward investors attracted by it’s talented and diverse workforce as well as it’s cutting-edge technologies and services. 

The Chancellor announced a record increase in public investment in R&D – committing to reaching £22bn per year by 2024/25. This includes how it aim’s to unlock and embrace student talents, diversity, resilience and adaptability, and to tackle it’s biggest challenges. [1](#references)

World-class research and development depends on talented people working in a diverse culture across multiple sectors and gaining access to the right funding to do their best work. 

As the UK aims to increase its investment in R&D to 2.4% of GDP by 2027, I want to research how R&D investments is spent and use this to explore the following research questions. 

- How can we encourage university students understand how important innovation and United Kingdom's research and development landscape is?  
- How can we attract and develop talented and diverse students to R&D roles? 
- How can we harness excitement about this vision, and inspire a whole new
generation of scientists, researchers, technicians, engineers, and innovators to the correct industry? 
    Attract industries to come in and speak?
- Where across the country can we engage with students to strengthen and improve
our drive to inspire academic students to learn about research and development.

My goal is to enable people from all backgrounds and experiences to engage with my visualisations and contribute to research and innovation and showcase that science is for everyone.

# Area of focus for my data visualisation project:

In July, the United Kingdom released a the UK Research and Development Roadmap. 
https://www.ukri.org/about-us/what-we-do/research-and-development-roadmap/#contents-list

Learning of the UK’s recognition for our leadership in research, and the excellence of it’s scientific institutions, and the innovation in the economy, I want to explore the statistical data of UK’s Research and Development funding landscape as the UK aims to revitalise it’s whole system of science, research and innovation.
