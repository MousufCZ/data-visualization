# Project Proposal

{(whoami|} {|whoami)}

{(task|}

You should complete this datavis project proposal by **Sunday 7th November, 5pm GMT** ensuring you have committed and pushed it to GitHub. Successful submissions by that time will be awarded up to **5 marks** towards your coursework assessment total.

{(questions|}
 
 The question I will look at is:

 *How well equiped are City, University of London building to make a positive impact on climate change. Can City, University of London be more energy efficient and reduce carbon emission.*

 I am focusing on City University Architecture and it's carbon footprint. This idea came from my concern for sustainable development when it meets climate change. As I believe modern technology such as IoT sensors can be a solution if required.

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

My focus is on how how historic and older buildings can help tackle the climate crisis.

There was a Proposal of the Government’s Planning White Paper (2020) which made recommendations for some limited change to planning policy and the historic built environment. 

These recommendations are for the planning framework to allow ‘where appropriate, sympathetic changes’ to historic buildings to better equip them for the challenges of climate change. (https://www.grosvenor.com/Grosvenor/files/c1/c19892d9-5734-4975-85df-5d2fab87228d.pdf)

Much of the documentation I have researched on climate change and old buildings around London have been text and report heavy. Very few have creative data visualisation which humanise this issue.

The issue with old buildings are that  the process of adapting these historic buildings so they can thrive in future and be more energy efficient is very challenging. 

My intention is show how by prortraying correct data in an art form can help better convince residence of london, city council, policy makers, building owners to invest in tackling this issue and the benefits every party can recieve from doing this.
