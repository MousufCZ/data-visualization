Proposal mark: 3 out of 5. Your research questions are thematically relevant and provide some pointers that may help you in your visualization design at the implementation phase. There is scope to align them more strongly with the visualization process, perhaps by making them more specific or in a way that isolates the aspect of understanding you are aiming to support. In that way  they should  help you to make design decisions when you get to the visualization design and implementation stages. You provide some justification for visualizing your data, but it could benefit from a greater focus on why data visualization specifically is an effective approach to take. That focus should help you to think further about why visualization is relevant to the investigation of your RQs and so should help you with the design process.
